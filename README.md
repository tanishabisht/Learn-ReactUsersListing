# Learn - React application for users Listing with Authentication

This is the first in a series of seven repositories designed to help you progress from basic to advanced React development. In this introductory project, we build a simple web application that manages user data through basic CRUD operationsâ€”Create, Read, Update, and Delete.


## Instructions to run the application
1. `nvm install v14.21.3`
2. `nvm use v14.21.3`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm start`


## TASK: Implement these features in your application
- **Authentication:** Enables users to sign up and sign in. Authentication verifies if the user's credentials are stored and correct.
- **User Management:** Authenticated users can view, edit, or delete other users' details directly through a user-friendly web interface.
- **CRUD Operations:** Implemented with plain JavaScript for learning purposes, with recommendations to use `axios` for practical applications.


## Libraries and Dependencies
1. **Bootstrap 4:** Provides CSS styling.
2. **React Bootstrap:** Offers Bootstrap components tailored for React.
3. **React Router Dom:** Facilitates routing in a single-page application setup.
4. **React Toastify:** Used for displaying notifications like warnings and success messages.
5. **React Loader Spinner:** Improves user experience by displaying loaders during data fetching or processing events.
